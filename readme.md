Files:
    - main.py: contains game data and working code
    - windows.py: aux function file I use since i use this function in every program and get tired of copy/pasting it

Functionality:
    - Input player names and click "Update Names" button
        - Game will not allow you to start until there is something in these fields
        - Once "Update Names" button is pressed, cannot update again until "Clear Score" is pressed
    - Game will prompt upon completion
